# Weather-CLI-app-using-OpenWeather-API
A Weather Command-Line Interface (CLI) application using the OpenWeather API is a software project designed to provide users with current weather information directly through their terminal or command prompt. 
Project Description: 
This project aims to develop a user-friendly and efficient CLI application that leverages the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve and display real-time weather data for specified locations. The application will allow users to query weather conditions by entering a city name, receiving key weather metrics such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a general weather description. 
Key Features: 

• City Name Input: Users can input a city name to obtain its current weather conditions. 
• OpenWeather API Integration: The application will make API calls to OpenWeatherMap to fetch accurate and up-to-date weather data. 
• Display of Key Weather Metrics: The output will include essential information like current temperature (in Celsius or Fahrenheit), "feels like" temperature, humidity percentage, wind speed and direction, and a brief weather description (e.g., "clear sky," "partly cloudy"). 
• Error Handling: The application will gracefully handle invalid city names or API errors, providing clear error messages to the user. 
• Customization (Optional): Potential enhancements could include options for units (Celsius/Fahrenheit), displaying sunrise/sunset times, or providing a multi-day forecast. 

Technical Stack (Example): 

• Programming Language: Python, Node.js, Go, or a similar language suitable for CLI development. 
• External API: OpenWeatherMap API. 
• Libraries/Modules: requests (for HTTP requests), json (for parsing API responses), and potentially argparse (for command-line argument parsing). 

Benefits: 

• Quick Access to Weather Information: Provides immediate weather updates without the need for a graphical interface. 
• Lightweight and Efficient: Operates directly in the terminal, consuming minimal system resources. 
• Educational Value: Serves as a practical project for learning API integration, command-line development, and data parsing.
